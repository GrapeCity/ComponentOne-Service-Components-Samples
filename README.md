# ComponentOne Data Services Samples 

Take your data management to the next level by building scalable services that run on any .NET platform. 

* Connect to cloud data sources and CRMs
* Efficiently load and display large data sets
* Analyze, slice, and pivot data

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne Data Services](https://www.grapecity.com/componentone/net-data-service-components). These samples provide complete implementation details for the component features. They are also included with the full download and install from grapecity.com/componentone. 

The samples reference but do not include the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from nuget.org.

## Building a Sample 

* .NET Framework samples require VS2012 and above. 
* .NET Core samples will require VS2017 and above. 

You can also build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). 

Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```
This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
