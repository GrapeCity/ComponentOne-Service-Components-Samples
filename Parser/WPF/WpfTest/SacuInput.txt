Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examined it. 
"I am quite sure I shall understand it," he replied, gazing intently at the little golden,
white-feathered disk, "and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it is 
quite incredible."
The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac-blooms, with their clustering 
stars, moved to and fro in the languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like
a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt as if
he could hear Basil Hallward's heart beating, and wondered what was coming.
"The story is simply this," said the painter after some time. "Two months ago I went to a crush at
Lady Brandon's. You know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just
to remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me
once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized."
