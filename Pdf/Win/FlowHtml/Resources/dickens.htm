            I <small>HAVE</small> endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost
            of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each
            other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no
            one wish to lay it.

            <h4>
                MARLEY&#8217;S GHOST.</h4>
        </center>
        <p>
            <span class="caps">Marley</span> was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever
            about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
            undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge&#8217;s name was
            good upon &#8217;Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was
            as dead as a door-nail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mind! I don&#8217;t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is
            particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard
            a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of
            our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or
            the Country&#8217;s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically,
            that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and
            he were partners for I don&#8217;t know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor,
            his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend,
            and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event,
            but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and
            solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mention of Marley&#8217;s funeral brings me back to the point I started from.
            There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing
            wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced
            that Hamlet&#8217;s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more
            remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
            than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after
            dark in a breezy spot&#8212;say Saint Paul&#8217;s Churchyard for instance&#8212;literally
            to astonish his son&#8217;s weak mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge never painted out Old Marley&#8217;s name. There it stood, years afterwards,
            above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and
            Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes
            Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching,
            grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from
            which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and
            solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed
            nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips
            blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head,
            and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always
            about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn&#8217;t thaw it one
            degree at Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
            External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no
            wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow
            was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather
            didn&#8217;t know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and
            sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often &#8220;came
            down&#8221; handsomely, and Scrooge never did.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, &#8220;My dear
            Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?&#8221; No beggars implored him
            to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o&#8217;clock, no man or woman
            ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.
            Even the blind men&#8217;s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming
            on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their
            tails as though they said, &#8220;No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark
            master!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along
            the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was
            what the knowing ones call &#8220;nuts&#8221; to Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once upon a time&#8212;of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve&#8212;old
            Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy
            withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down,
            beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement
            stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite
            dark already&#8212;it had not been light all day&#8212;and candles were flaring
            in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable
            brown air. The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense
            without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were
            mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything,
            one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            The door of Scrooge&#8217;s counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon
            his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters.
            Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk&#8217;s fire was so very much smaller
            that it looked like one coal. But he couldn&#8217;t replenish it, for Scrooge kept
            the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel,
            the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the
            clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which
            effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!&#8221; cried a cheerful voice. It
            was the voice of Scrooge&#8217;s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this
            was the first intimation he had of his approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Bah!&#8221; said Scrooge, &#8220;Humbug!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of
            Scrooge&#8217;s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his
            eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Christmas a humbug, uncle!&#8221; said Scrooge&#8217;s nephew. &#8220;You
            don&#8217;t mean that, I am sure?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I do,&#8221; said Scrooge. &#8220;Merry Christmas! What right have you to
            be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You&#8217;re poor enough.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Come, then,&#8221; returned the nephew gaily. &#8220;What right have you
            to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You&#8217;re rich enough.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, &#8220;Bah!&#8221;
            again; and followed it up with &#8220;Humbug.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Don&#8217;t be cross, uncle!&#8221; said the nephew.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;What else can I be,&#8221; returned the uncle, &#8220;when I live in such
            a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What&#8217;s
            Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding
            yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and
            having every item in &#8217;em through a round dozen of months presented dead against
            you? If I could work my will,&#8221; said Scrooge indignantly, &#8220;every idiot
            who goes about with &#8216;Merry Christmas&#8217; on his lips, should be boiled
            with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Uncle!&#8221; pleaded the nephew.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Nephew!&#8221; returned the uncle sternly, &#8220;keep Christmas in your
            own way, and let me keep it in mine.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Keep it!&#8221; repeated Scrooge&#8217;s nephew. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t
            keep it.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Let me leave it alone, then,&#8221; said Scrooge. &#8220;Much good may it
            do you! Much good it has ever done you!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have
            not profited, I dare say,&#8221; returned the nephew. &#8220;Christmas among the
            rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round&#8212;apart
            from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to
            it can be apart from that&#8212;as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant
            time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women
            seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people
            below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another
            race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never
            put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it <i>has</i> done me
            good, and <i>will</i> do me good; and I say, God bless it!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of
            the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Let me hear another sound from <i>you</i>,&#8221; said Scrooge, &#8220;and
            you&#8217;ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation! You&#8217;re quite a
            powerful speaker, sir,&#8221; he added, turning to his nephew. &#8220;I wonder you
            don&#8217;t go into Parliament.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge said that he would see him&#8212;yes, indeed he did. He went the whole length
            of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;But why?&#8221; cried Scrooge&#8217;s nephew. &#8220;Why?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Why did you get married?&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Because I fell in love.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Because you fell in love!&#8221; growled Scrooge, as if that were the only
            one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. &#8220;Good afternoon!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it
            as a reason for not coming now?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Good afternoon,&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Good afternoon,&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never had
            any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage to
            Christmas, and I&#8217;ll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas,
            uncle!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Good afternoon!&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;And A Happy New Year!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Good afternoon!&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the
            outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was,
            was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;There&#8217;s another fellow,&#8221; muttered Scrooge; who overheard him:
            &#8220;my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about
            a merry Christmas. I&#8217;ll retire to Bedlam.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            This lunatic, in letting Scrooge&#8217;s nephew out, had let two other people in.
            They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,
            in Scrooge&#8217;s office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to
            him.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Scrooge and Marley&#8217;s, I believe,&#8221; said one of the gentlemen,
            referring to his list. &#8220;Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or
            Mr. Marley?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,&#8221; Scrooge replied. &#8220;He
            died seven years ago, this very night.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,&#8221;
            said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
            It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous word &#8220;liberality,&#8221;
            Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,&#8221; said the gentleman,
            taking up a pen, &#8220;it is more than usually desirable that we should make some
            slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.
            Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want
            of common comforts, sir.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Are there no prisons?&#8221; asked Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Plenty of prisons,&#8221; said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;And the Union workhouses?&#8221; demanded Scrooge. &#8220;Are they still
            in operation?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;They are. Still,&#8221; returned the gentleman, &#8220;I wish I could say
            they were not.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Both very busy, sir.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred
            to stop them in their useful course,&#8221; said Scrooge. &#8220;I&#8217;m very
            glad to hear it.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or
            body to the multitude,&#8221; returned the gentleman, &#8220;a few of us are endeavouring
            to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We choose
            this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance
            rejoices. What shall I put you down for?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Nothing!&#8221; Scrooge replied.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You wish to be anonymous?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I wish to be left alone,&#8221; said Scrooge. &#8220;Since you ask me what
            I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer. I don&#8217;t make merry myself at Christmas
            and I can&#8217;t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the establishments
            I have mentioned&#8212;they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Many can&#8217;t go there; and many would rather die.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;If they would rather die,&#8221; said Scrooge, &#8220;they had better do
            it, and decrease the surplus population. Besides&#8212;excuse me&#8212;I don&#8217;t
            know that.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;But you might know it,&#8221; observed the gentleman.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;It&#8217;s not my business,&#8221; Scrooge returned. &#8220;It&#8217;s enough
            for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people&#8217;s.
            Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew.
            Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious
            temper than was usual with him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring
            links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them
            on their way. The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping
            slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and
            struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards
            as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became intense.
            In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the
            gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged
            men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the
            blaze in rapture. The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly
            congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops where holly
            sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy
            as they passed. Poulterers&#8217; and grocers&#8217; trades became a splendid joke:
            a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull
            principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold
            of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep
            Christmas as a Lord Mayor&#8217;s household should; and even the little tailor,
            whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty
            in the streets, stirred up to-morrow&#8217;s pudding in his garret, while his lean
            wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.
        </p>
        <p>
            Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good Saint Dunstan
            had but nipped the Evil Spirit&#8217;s nose with a touch of such weather as that,
            instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty
            purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold
            as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge&#8217;s keyhole to regale him
            with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of
        </p>
        <center>
            <br>
            <table summary="carol">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        &#8220;God bless you, merry gentleman!<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;May nothing you dismay!&#8221;
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
        </center>
        <p class="noindent">
            Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror,
            leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.
        </p>
        <p>
            At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge
            dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk
            in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You&#8217;ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;If quite convenient, sir.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;It&#8217;s not convenient,&#8221; said Scrooge, &#8220;and it&#8217;s not
            fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you&#8217;d think yourself ill-used,
            I&#8217;ll be bound?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            The clerk smiled faintly.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;And yet,&#8221; said Scrooge, &#8220;you don&#8217;t think <i>me</i> ill-used,
            when I pay a day&#8217;s wages for no work.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            The clerk observed that it was only once a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;A poor excuse for picking a man&#8217;s pocket every twenty-fifth of December!&#8221;
            said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. &#8220;But I suppose you must
            have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next morning.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office
            was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter
            dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,
            at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve,
            and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman&#8217;s-buff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read
            all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker&#8217;s-book,
            went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner.
            They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where
            it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have
            run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,
            and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody
            lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices. The yard
            was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with
            his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that
            it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on
            the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen
            it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge
            had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London,
            even including&#8212;which is a bold word&#8212;the corporation, aldermen, and livery.
            Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley,
            since his last mention of his seven years&#8217; dead partner that afternoon. And
            then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having
            his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any
            intermediate process of change&#8212;not a knocker, but Marley&#8217;s face.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marley&#8217;s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the
            yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar.
            It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with
            ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The hair was curiously stirred,
            as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly
            motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed
            to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own
            expression.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.
        </p>
        <p>
            To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible
            sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue. But he
            put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and
            lighted his candle.
        </p>
        <p>
            He <i>did</i> pause, with a moment&#8217;s irresolution, before he shut the door;
            and he <i>did</i> look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be
            terrified with the sight of Marley&#8217;s pigtail sticking out into the hall. But
            there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held
            the knocker on, so he said &#8220;Pooh, pooh!&#8221; and closed it with a bang.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above, and every
            cask in the wine-merchant&#8217;s cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal
            of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened
            the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his
            candle as he went.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs,
            or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a
            hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards
            the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty
            of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought
            he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps
            out of the street wouldn&#8217;t have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose
            that it was pretty dark with Scrooge&#8217;s dip.
        </p>
        <p>
            Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked
            it. But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all
            was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under the table,
            nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the
            little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under
            the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up
            in a suspicious attitude against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,
            old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself
            in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat;
            put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the
            fire to take his gruel.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to
            sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation
            of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some
            Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to
            illustrate the Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh&#8217;s daughters;
            Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds,
            Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of
            figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead,
            came like the ancient Prophet&#8217;s rod, and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth
            tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface
            from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old
            Marley&#8217;s head on every one.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Humbug!&#8221; said Scrooge; and walked across the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            After several turns, he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the chair,
            his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room,
            and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story
            of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable
            dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in
            the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did
            every bell in the house.
        </p>
        <p>
            This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells
            ceased as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep
            down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the
            wine-merchant&#8217;s cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts
            in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much
            louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards
            his door.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;It&#8217;s humbug still!&#8221; said Scrooge. &#8220;I won&#8217;t believe
            it.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door,
            and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped
            up, as though it cried, &#8220;I know him; Marley&#8217;s Ghost!&#8221; and fell
            again.

            and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was
            long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it
            closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought
            in steel. His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking
            through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed
            it until now.
        </p>
        <p>
            No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through,
            and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold
            eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and
            chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought
            against his senses.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;How now!&#8221; said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. &#8220;What do you
            want with me?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Much!&#8221;&#8212;Marley&#8217;s voice, no doubt about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Ask me who I <i>was</i>.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Who <i>were</i> you then?&#8221; said Scrooge, raising his voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re
            particular, for a shade.&#8221; He was going to say &#8220;<i>to</i> a shade,&#8221;
            but substituted this, as more appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Can you&#8212;can you sit down?&#8221; asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully
            at him.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I can.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Do it, then.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge asked the question, because he didn&#8217;t know whether a ghost so transparent
            might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of
            its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation.
            But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite
            used to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You don&#8217;t believe in me,&#8221; observed the Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Why do you doubt your senses?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Because,&#8221; said Scrooge, &#8220;a little thing affects them. A slight
            disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,
            a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There&#8217;s
            more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart,
            by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of
            distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre&#8217;s
            voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.
        </p>
        <p>
            To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play,
            Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something very awful, too, in the
            spectre&#8217;s being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could
            not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly
            motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot
            vapour from an oven.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You see this toothpick?&#8221; said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,
            for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to
            divert the vision&#8217;s stony gaze from himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I do,&#8221; replied the Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You are not looking at it,&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;But I see it,&#8221; said the Ghost, &#8220;notwithstanding.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Well!&#8221; returned Scrooge, &#8220;I have but to swallow this, and be
            for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation.
            Humbug, I tell you! humbug!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal
            and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from
            falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking
            off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower
            jaw dropped down upon its breast!
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Mercy!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Man of the worldly mind!&#8221; replied the Ghost, &#8220;do you believe
            in me or not?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I do,&#8221; said Scrooge. &#8220;I must. But why do spirits walk the earth,
            and why do they come to me?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;It is required of every man,&#8221; the Ghost returned, &#8220;that the spirit
            within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and
            if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. It
            is doomed to wander through the world&#8212;oh, woe is me!&#8212;and witness what
            it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You are fettered,&#8221; said Scrooge, trembling. &#8220;Tell me why?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I wear the chain I forged in life,&#8221; replied the Ghost. &#8220;I made
            it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my
            own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to <i>you?</i>&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge trembled more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Or would you know,&#8221; pursued the Ghost, &#8220;the weight and length
            of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this,
            seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since. It is a ponderous chain!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded
            by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Jacob,&#8221; he said, imploringly. &#8220;Old Jacob Marley, tell me more.
            Speak comfort to me, Jacob!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I have none to give,&#8221; the Ghost replied. &#8220;It comes from other
            regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of
            men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me.
            I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond
            our counting-house&#8212;mark me!&#8212;in life my spirit never roved beyond the
            narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in
            his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without
            lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,&#8221; Scrooge observed, in
            a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Slow!&#8221; the Ghost repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Seven years dead,&#8221; mused Scrooge. &#8220;And travelling all the time!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;The whole time,&#8221; said the Ghost. &#8220;No rest, no peace. Incessant
            torture of remorse.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You travel fast?&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;On the wings of the wind,&#8221; replied the Ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,&#8221;
            said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously
            in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting
            it for a nuisance.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,&#8221; cried the phantom, &#8220;not
            to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must
            pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed.
            Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever
            it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness.
            Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life&#8217;s opportunity
            misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,&#8221; faltered Scrooge,
            who now began to apply this to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Business!&#8221; cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. &#8220;Mankind
            was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,
            and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop
            of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            It held up its chain at arm&#8217;s length, as if that were the cause of all its
            unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;At this time of the rolling year,&#8221; the spectre said, &#8220;I suffer
            most. Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and
            never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were
            there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted <i>me!</i>&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began
            to quake exceedingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Hear me!&#8221; cried the Ghost. &#8220;My time is nearly gone.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I will,&#8221; said Scrooge. &#8220;But don&#8217;t be hard upon me! Don&#8217;t
            be flowery, Jacob! Pray!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not
            tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from
            his brow.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;That is no light part of my penance,&#8221; pursued the Ghost. &#8220;I am
            here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate.
            A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You were always a good friend to me,&#8221; said Scrooge. &#8220;Thank&#8217;ee!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;You will be haunted,&#8221; resumed the Ghost, &#8220;by Three Spirits.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge&#8217;s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost&#8217;s had done.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?&#8221; he demanded, in
            a faltering voice.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;It is.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;I&#8212;I think I&#8217;d rather not,&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Without their visits,&#8221; said the Ghost, &#8220;you cannot hope to shun
            the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I take &#8217;em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?&#8221;
            hinted Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the
            next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me
            no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between
            us!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound
            it round its head, as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made,
            when the jaws were brought together by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes
            again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude,
            with its chain wound over and about its arm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised
            itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.
        </p>
        <p>
            It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of
            each other, Marley&#8217;s Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer.
            Scrooge stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand,
            he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation
            and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory. The spectre, after
            listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak,
            dark night.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.
        </p>
        <p>
            The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste,
            and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley&#8217;s Ghost;
            some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free.
            Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar
            with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to
            its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an
            infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step. The misery with them all was, clearly,
            that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power
            for ever.

        <p>
            Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell.
            But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had
            been when he walked home.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered.
            It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were
            undisturbed. He tried to say &#8220;Humbug!&#8221; but stopped at the first syllable.
            And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his
            glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness
            of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and
            fell asleep upon the instant.
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
        </p>
        <center>
            <h2 id="2">STAVE &nbsp;TWO.</h2>
            <hr width="50">
            <h4>
                THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS.</h4>
        </center>
        <p>
            <span class="caps">When</span> Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of
            bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls
            of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes,
            when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened
            for the hour.
        </p>
        <p>
            To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven
            to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when
            he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works. Twelve!
        </p>
        <p>
            He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock.
            Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Why, it isn&#8217;t possible,&#8221; said Scrooge, &#8220;that I can have
            slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn&#8217;t possible that
            anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the
            window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown
            before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make
            out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no
            noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably
            would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the
            world. This was a great relief, because &#8220;three days after sight of this First
            of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,&#8221; and so forth, would
            have become a mere United States&#8217; security if there were no days to count
            by.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over
            and over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more perplexed
            he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marley&#8217;s Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within himself,
            after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a
            strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to
            be worked all through, &#8220;Was it a dream or not?&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he
            remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the
            bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering
            that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest
            resolution in his power.
        </p>
        <p>
            The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk
            into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock. At length it broke upon his listening
            ear.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Ding, dong!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;A quarter past,&#8221; said Scrooge, counting.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Ding, dong!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Half-past!&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Ding, dong!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;A quarter to it,&#8221; said Scrooge.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;Ding, dong!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8220;The hour itself,&#8221; said Scrooge, triumphantly, &#8220;and nothing else!&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow,
            melancholy <span class="caps">One</span>. Light flashed up in the room upon the
            instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.
